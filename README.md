# Track Your Reading

The objective of this project was to create a mobile app, which can track any specific things and presented with a list of things to be measured. This app is using a back-end part, for the Back-End part, where I have created API and endpoints, I have used Rails.

## Application Description:

1. An user needs to Sign-up with a username and password.
2. The username's length needs to be at least 4.
3. The password's length needs to be at least 6.
4. After Log-in/Sign-in the user is presented with the list of books.
5. If the user is new, then they can add books by clicking the `+` sign in the header.
6. While creating the books, the user has to enter a name, author, genre, and how many pages.
7. After successful creation, the user can see the newly created book on the main page.
8. To start tracking, the user needs to click on the book object.
9. Then they will drag to create the tracking page, where they need to add the date and number of pages they are in.
10. After clicking the button save, they have saved the page numbers.
